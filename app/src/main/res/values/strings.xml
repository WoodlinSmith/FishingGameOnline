            This is a fishing game where you capture fish using various tools at your disposal.
            Enter the name of the 2 players and the number of rounds in the boxes below.
            \nPlayers get 1 turn each in every round where they can move
            around the fisherman and then fish using one of the 3 tools.
            The three choices of tools are - a round net, a rectangular net and a spear.
            The round net can be moved around in a limited area and can capture the closest
            fish from among the ones it overlaps. The rectangular net is flexible
            and can be made bigger or smaller. Bigger the net, lesser the probability
            of catching fish. The spear can be moved and rotated. It has a 100%% chance of capturing
            every fish it hits. At the end of the game the player with the higher number of captures wins.\n</string>
